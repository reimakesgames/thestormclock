# thestormclock

This site aims to be a utility tool to practice your storm timings for fortnite.
It's a simple tool that visually shows the time between circles, and additional
stats such as storm surge values, damage, next type of circle, etc.

## How to use?

Visit the [site](https://reimakesgames.github.io/thestormclock/) and click the start
button when the first circle appears. But there are other buttons that you can use
if ever you're in a situation on early drops.

## How to contribute?

Submit an issue or a pull request. I'm open to suggestions and improvements.

If there is an update to the storm timings, submit a pull request with the updated
timings or simply submit an issue with the new timings.
